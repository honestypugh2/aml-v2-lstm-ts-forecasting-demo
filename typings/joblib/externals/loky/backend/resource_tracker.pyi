    This class is an extension of the multiprocessing ResourceTracker class
    which implements a reference counting scheme to avoid unlinking shared
    resources still in use in other processes.

    This feature is notably used by `joblib.Parallel` to share temporary
    folders and memory mapped files between the main process and the worker
    processes.

    The actual implementation of the refcounting scheme is in the main
    function, which is run in a dedicated process.
