class parallel_config:
    """Set the default backend or configuration for :class:`~joblib.Parallel`.

    This is an alternative to directly passing keyword arguments to the
    :class:`~joblib.Parallel` class constructor. It is particularly useful when
    calling into library code that uses joblib internally but does not expose
    the various parallel configuration arguments in its own API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    backend: str or ParallelBackendBase instance, default=None
        If ``backend`` is a string it must match a previously registered
        implementation using the :func:`~register_parallel_backend` function.

        By default the following backends are available:

        - 'loky': single-host, process-based parallelism (used by default),
        - 'threading': single-host, thread-based parallelism,
        - 'multiprocessing': legacy single-host, process-based parallelism.

        'loky' is recommended to run functions that manipulate Python objects.
        'threading' is a low-overhead alternative that is most efficient for
        functions that release the Global Interpreter Lock: e.g. I/O-bound
        code or CPU-bound code in a few calls to native code that explicitly
        releases the GIL. Note that on some rare systems (such as pyodide),
        multiprocessing and loky may not be available, in which case joblib
        defaults to threading.

        In addition, if the ``dask`` and ``distributed`` Python packages are
        installed, it is possible to use the 'dask' backend for better
        scheduling of nested parallel calls without over-subscription and
        potentially distribute parallel calls over a networked cluster of
        several hosts.

        It is also possible to use the distributed 'ray' backend for
        distributing the workload to a cluster of nodes. See more details
        in the Examples section below.

        Alternatively the backend can be passed directly as an instance.

    n_jobs: int, default=None
        The maximum number of concurrently running jobs, such as the number
        of Python worker processes when ``backend="loky"`` or the size of the
        thread-pool when ``backend="threading"``.
        This argument is converted to an integer, rounded below for float.
        If -1 is given, `joblib` tries to use all CPUs. The number of CPUs
        ``n_cpus`` is obtained with :func:`~cpu_count`.
        For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. For instance,
        using ``n_jobs=-2`` will result in all CPUs but one being used.
        This argument can also go above ``n_cpus``, which will cause
        oversubscription. In some cases, slight oversubscription can be
        beneficial, e.g., for tasks with large I/O operations.
        If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is used at all, and the
        behavior amounts to a simple python `for` loop. This mode is not
        compatible with `timeout`.
        None is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted as n_jobs=1
        unless the call is performed under a :func:`~parallel_config`
        context manager that sets another value for ``n_jobs``.
        If n_jobs = 0 then a ValueError is raised.

    verbose: int, default=0
        The verbosity level: if non zero, progress messages are
        printed. Above 50, the output is sent to stdout.
        The frequency of the messages increases with the verbosity level.
        If it more than 10, all iterations are reported.

    temp_folder: str or None, default=None
        Folder to be used by the pool for memmapping large arrays
        for sharing memory with worker processes. If None, this will try in
        order:

        - a folder pointed by the ``JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER`` environment
          variable,
        - ``/dev/shm`` if the folder exists and is writable: this is a
          RAM disk filesystem available by default on modern Linux
          distributions,
        - the default system temporary folder that can be
          overridden with ``TMP``, ``TMPDIR`` or ``TEMP`` environment
          variables, typically ``/tmp`` under Unix operating systems.

    max_nbytes: int, str, or None, optional, default='1M'
        Threshold on the size of arrays passed to the workers that
        triggers automated memory mapping in temp_folder. Can be an int
        in Bytes, or a human-readable string, e.g., '1M' for 1 megabyte.
        Use None to disable memmapping of large arrays.

    mmap_mode: {None, 'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'}, default='r'
        Memmapping mode for numpy arrays passed to workers. None will
        disable memmapping, other modes defined in the numpy.memmap doc:
        https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html
        Also, see 'max_nbytes' parameter documentation for more details.

    prefer: str in {'processes', 'threads'} or None, default=None
        Soft hint to choose the default backend.
        The default process-based backend is 'loky' and the default
        thread-based backend is 'threading'. Ignored if the ``backend``
        parameter is specified.

    require: 'sharedmem' or None, default=None
        Hard constraint to select the backend. If set to 'sharedmem',
        the selected backend will be single-host and thread-based.

    inner_max_num_threads: int, default=None
        If not None, overwrites the limit set on the number of threads
        usable in some third-party library threadpools like OpenBLAS,
        MKL or OpenMP. This is only used with the ``loky`` backend.

    backend_params: dict
        Additional parameters to pass to the backend constructor when
        backend is a string.

    Notes
    -----
    Joblib tries to limit the oversubscription by limiting the number of
    threads usable in some third-party library threadpools like OpenBLAS, MKL
    or OpenMP. The default limit in each worker is set to
    ``max(cpu_count() // effective_n_jobs, 1)`` but this limit can be
    overwritten with the ``inner_max_num_threads`` argument which will be used
    to set this limit in the child processes.

    You can also use the `Dask <https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/>`_ joblib
    backend to distribute work across machines. This works well with
    scikit-learn estimators with the ``n_jobs`` parameter, for example::

    ... # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> with joblib.parallel_backend("dask", scatter=[X, y]):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     grid_search.fit(X, y)

    It is also possible to use the distributed 'ray' backend for distributing
    the workload to a cluster of nodes. To use the 'ray' joblib backend add
    the following lines::

     >>> from ray.util.joblib import register_ray  # doctest: +SKIP
     >>> register_ray()  # doctest: +SKIP
     >>> with parallel_backend("ray"):  # doctest: +SKIP
     ...     print(Parallel()(delayed(neg)(i + 1) for i in range(5)))
     [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]

    Alternatively the backend can be passed directly as an instance.

    By default all available workers will be used (``n_jobs=-1``) unless the
    caller passes an explicit value for the ``n_jobs`` parameter.

    This is an alternative to passing a ``backend='backend_name'`` argument to
    the :class:`~Parallel` class constructor. It is particularly useful when
    calling into library code that uses joblib internally but does not expose
    the backend argument in its own API.

    Joblib also tries to limit the oversubscription by limiting the number of
    threads usable in some third-party library threadpools like OpenBLAS, MKL

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_jobs: int, default=None
        The maximum number of concurrently running jobs, such as the number
        of Python worker processes when ``backend="loky"`` or the size of
        the thread-pool when ``backend="threading"``.
        This argument is converted to an integer, rounded below for float.
        If -1 is given, `joblib` tries to use all CPUs. The number of CPUs
        ``n_cpus`` is obtained with :func:`~cpu_count`.
        For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. For instance,
        using ``n_jobs=-2`` will result in all CPUs but one being used.
        This argument can also go above ``n_cpus``, which will cause
        oversubscription. In some cases, slight oversubscription can be

        If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is used at all, and the
        behavior amounts to a simple python `for` loop. This mode is not
        compatible with ``timeout``.
        None is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted as n_jobs=1

        context manager that sets another value for ``n_jobs``.
        If n_jobs = 0 then a ValueError is raised.
    backend: str, ParallelBackendBase instance or None, default='loky'
        Specify the parallelization backend implementation.
        Supported backends are:

        - "loky" used by default, can induce some
          communication and memory overhead when exchanging input and
          output data with the worker Python processes. On some rare
          systems (such as Pyiodide), the loky backend may not be
          available.
        - "multiprocessing" previous process-based backend based on
          `multiprocessing.Pool`. Less robust than `loky`.
        - "threading" is a very low-overhead backend but it suffers
          from the Python Global Interpreter Lock if the called function
          relies a lot on Python objects. "threading" is mostly useful
          when the execution bottleneck is a compiled extension that
          explicitly releases the GIL (for instance a Cython loop wrapped
          in a "with nogil" block or an expensive call to a library such
          as NumPy).
        - finally, you can register backends by calling
          :func:`~register_parallel_backend`. This will allow you to
          implement a backend of your liking.

        It is not recommended to hard-code the backend name in a call to
        :class:`~Parallel` in a library. Instead it is recommended to set
        soft hints (prefer) or hard constraints (require) so as to make it
        possible for library users to change the backend from the outside
        using the :func:`~parallel_config` context manager.
    return_as: str in {'list', 'generator', 'generator_unordered'}, default='list'
        If 'list', calls to this instance will return a list, only when
        all results have been processed and retrieved.
        If 'generator', it will return a generator that yields the results
        as soon as they are available, in the order the tasks have been
        submitted with.
        If 'generator_unordered', the generator will immediately yield
        available results independently of the submission order. The output
        order is not deterministic in this case because it depends on the
        concurrency of the workers.
    prefer: str in {'processes', 'threads'} or None, default=None
        Soft hint to choose the default backend if no specific backend
        was selected with the :func:`~parallel_config` context manager.
        The default process-based backend is 'loky' and the default
        thread-based backend is 'threading'. Ignored if the ``backend``
        parameter is specified.
    require: 'sharedmem' or None, default=None
        Hard constraint to select the backend. If set to 'sharedmem',
        the selected backend will be single-host and thread-based even
        if the user asked for a non-thread based backend with
        :func:`~joblib.parallel_config`.
    verbose: int, default=0
        The verbosity level: if non zero, progress messages are
        printed. Above 50, the output is sent to stdout.
        The frequency of the messages increases with the verbosity level.
        If it more than 10, all iterations are reported.
    timeout: float or None, default=None
        Timeout limit for each task to complete.  If any task takes longer
        a TimeOutError will be raised. Only applied when n_jobs != 1
    pre_dispatch: {'all', integer, or expression, as in '3*n_jobs'}, default='2*n_jobs'
        The number of batches (of tasks) to be pre-dispatched.
        Default is '2*n_jobs'. When batch_size="auto" this is reasonable
        default and the workers should never starve. Note that only basic
        arithmetic are allowed here and no modules can be used in this
        expression.
    batch_size: int or 'auto', default='auto'
        The number of atomic tasks to dispatch at once to each
        worker. When individual evaluations are very fast, dispatching
        calls to workers can be slower than sequential computation because
        of the overhead. Batching fast computations together can mitigate
        this.
        The ``'auto'`` strategy keeps track of the time it takes for a
        batch to complete, and dynamically adjusts the batch size to keep
        the time on the order of half a second, using a heuristic. The
        initial batch size is 1.
        ``batch_size="auto"`` with ``backend="threading"`` will dispatch
        batches of a single task at a time as the threading backend has
        very little overhead and using larger batch size has not proved to
        bring any gain in that case.
    temp_folder: str or None, default=None
        Folder to be used by the pool for memmapping large arrays
        for sharing memory with worker processes. If None, this will try in
        order:

        - a folder pointed by the JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER environment
          variable,
        - /dev/shm if the folder exists and is writable: this is a
          RAM disk filesystem available by default on modern Linux
          distributions,
        - the default system temporary folder that can be
          overridden with TMP, TMPDIR or TEMP environment
          variables, typically /tmp under Unix operating systems.

        Only active when ``backend="loky"`` or ``"multiprocessing"``.
    max_nbytes int, str, or None, optional, default='1M'
        Threshold on the size of arrays passed to the workers that
        triggers automated memory mapping in temp_folder. Can be an int
        in Bytes, or a human-readable string, e.g., '1M' for 1 megabyte.
        Use None to disable memmapping of large arrays.
        Only active when ``backend="loky"`` or ``"multiprocessing"``.
    mmap_mode: {None, 'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'}, default='r'
        Memmapping mode for numpy arrays passed to workers. None will
        disable memmapping, other modes defined in the numpy.memmap doc:
        https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html
        Also, see 'max_nbytes' parameter documentation for more details.
    backend_kwargs: dict, optional
        Additional parameters to pass to the backend `configure` method.

    This object uses workers to compute in parallel the application of a
    function to many different arguments. The main functionality it brings
    in addition to using the raw multiprocessing or concurrent.futures API
    are (see examples for details):

    * More readable code, in particular since it avoids
      constructing list of arguments.

    * Easier debugging:
        - informative tracebacks even when the error happens on
          the client side
        - using 'n_jobs=1' enables to turn off parallel computing
          for debugging without changing the codepath
        - early capture of pickling errors

    * An optional progress meter.

    * Interruption of multiprocesses jobs with 'Ctrl-C'

    * Flexible pickling control for the communication to and from
      the worker processes.

    * Ability to use shared memory efficiently with worker
      processes for large numpy-based datastructures.

    Note that the intended usage is to run one call at a time. Multiple
    calls to the same Parallel object will result in a ``RuntimeError``

    Examples
    --------

    A simple example:

    >>> from math import sqrt
    >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    >>> Parallel(n_jobs=1)(delayed(sqrt)(i**2) for i in range(10))
    [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]

    Reshaping the output when the function has several return
    values:

    >>> from math import modf
    >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    >>> r = Parallel(n_jobs=1)(delayed(modf)(i/2.) for i in range(10))
    >>> res, i = zip(*r)
    >>> res
    (0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5)
    >>> i
    (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0)

    The progress meter: the higher the value of `verbose`, the more
    messages:

    >>> from time import sleep
    >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    >>> r = Parallel(n_jobs=2, verbose=10)(
    ...     delayed(sleep)(.2) for _ in range(10)) #doctest: +SKIP
    [Parallel(n_jobs=2)]: Done   1 tasks      | elapsed:    0.6s
    [Parallel(n_jobs=2)]: Done   4 tasks      | elapsed:    0.8s
    [Parallel(n_jobs=2)]: Done  10 out of  10 | elapsed:    1.4s finished

    Traceback example, note how the line of the error is indicated
    as well as the values of the parameter passed to the function that
    triggered the exception, even though the traceback happens in the
    child process:

    >>> from heapq import nlargest
    >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    >>> Parallel(n_jobs=2)(
    ... delayed(nlargest)(2, n) for n in (range(4), 'abcde', 3))
    ... # doctest: +SKIP

    Using pre_dispatch in a producer/consumer situation, where the
    data is generated on the fly. Note how the producer is first
    called 3 times before the parallel loop is initiated, and then
    called to generate new data on the fly:

    >>> from math import sqrt
    >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    >>> def producer():
    ...     for i in range(6):
    ...         print('Produced %s' % i)
    ...         yield i
    >>> out = Parallel(n_jobs=2, verbose=100, pre_dispatch='1.5*n_jobs')(
    ...     delayed(sqrt)(i) for i in producer()) #doctest: +SKIP
